# Hikari - Wayland Compositor

![Screenshot](https://acmelabs.space/~raichoo/hikari.png)

## Description

_hikari_ is a stacking Wayland compositor with additional tiling capabilities,
it is heavily inspired by the Calm Window manager (cwm(1)). Its core concepts
are *views*, *groups*, *sheets* and the *workspace*.

The workspace is the set of views that are currently visible.

A sheet is a collection of views, each view can only be a member of a single
sheet. Switching between sheets will replace the current content of the
workspace with all the views that are a member of the selected sheet. _hikari_
has 9 general purpose sheets that correspond to the numbers **1** to **9** and a
special purpose sheet **0**. Views that are a member of sheet **0** will
always be visible but stacked below the views of the selected sheet.

Groups are a bit more fine grained than sheets. Like sheets, groups are a
collection of views. Unlike sheets you can have a arbitrary number of groups
and each group can have an arbitrary name. Views from one group can be spread
among all available sheets. Some operations act on entire groups rather than
individual views.

## Setting up Wayland on FreeBSD

Wayland currently requires some care to work properly on FreeBSD. This section
aims to document the recent state of how to enable Wayland on the FreeBSD
`STABLE` branch and will change once support is being improved.

### Mouse configuration

To make mice work `kern.evdev.rcpt_mask` should be set to `12`. Depending on
your version of FreeBSD this is done automatically or via setting the value in
`/etc/sysctl.conf`.

Some systems might require `moused` for mice to work. Enable it with `service
moused enable`. This requires setting `kern.evdev.rcpt_mask` to `3`.

### Setting up XDG\_RUNTIME\_DIR

This section describes how to use `/tmp` as your `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`. Some Wayland
clients (e.g. native Wayland `firefox`) require `posix_fallocate` to work in
that directory. This is not supported by ZFS, therefore you should prevent the
ZFS tmp dataset from mounting to `/tmp` and `mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /tmp`. To
persist this setting edit your `/etc/fstab` appropriately to automatically mount
`tmpfs` during boot.

Additionally set `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` to `/tmp` in your environment.

### Setting up PAM

Setting up PAM is needed to give `hikari` the ability to unlock the screen when
using the screen locker. Copy the appropriate `hikari-unlocker` file from the
`pam.d` folder to `/usr/local/etc/pam.d` (or `/etc/pam.d` on most Linux
systems).

### Setting up the keyboard layout

`hikari` gets its keyboard settings from `xkb` environment variables. To select
a layout set the `XKB_DEFAULT_LAYOUT` to the desired value before staring
`hikari`.

```
XKB_DEFAULT_LAYOUT "de(nodeadkeys),de"
```

## Building

`hikari` currently only works on FreeBSD and Linux. This will likely change in
the future when more systems adopt Wayland. When building directly from the
repository, breaking changes might be encountered. These are documented in the
`UPDATING` file which should be consulted before updating to a newer build.

### Dependencies

* wlroots
* pango
* cairo
* libinput
* xkbcommon
* pixman
* libucl
* evdev-proto
* epoll-shim (FreeBSD)
* XWayland (optional, runtime dependency)

### Compiling and Installing

The build process will produce two binaries `hikari` and `hikari-unlocker`. The
latter one is used to check credentials for unlocking the screen. Both need to
be installed with root setuid in your `PATH`.

`hikari` can be configured via `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/hikari/hikari.conf`, the
default configuration can be found under `$PREFIX/etc/hikari/hikari.conf`
(depending on the value of `PREFIX` that was specified during the installation).

The default configuration expects your default terminal emulator to be specified
in the `$TERMINAL` environment variable.

The installation destination can be configured by setting `PREFIX` (default is
`/usr/local` and does not need to be given explicitly). If you want to install
`hikari` into a directory other than `/usr/local` you always should state the
`PREFIX` when issuing `make`, since this information is also used to specify
where `hikari` can find the default configuration on your system and is needed
during the compilation process. To override installation paths for `etc` specify
`ETC_PREFIX`.

#### Building on FreeBSD

Simply run `make`. The installation destination can be configured by setting
`PREFIX` (default is `/usr/local` and does not need to be given explicitly).

```
make
```

`uninstall` requires the same values for prefixes.

#### Building on Linux

On Linux `bmake` is required which needs to be run like so:

```
bmake WITH_POSIX_C_SOURCE=YES
```

The installation destination can be configured by
setting`PREFIX` (default is `/usr/local` and does not need to be given
explicitly).

```
bmake PREFIX=/usr/local install
```

`uninstall` requires the same values for prefixes.

### Building with all features enabled

The following sections explain how to enabled features on an individual basis.
However, to enable every feature the build system offers the `WITH_ALL` flag.

```
make WITH_ALL=YES
```

#### Building with XWayland support

`hikari` offers optional XWayland support which is enabled via setting
`WITH_XWAYLAND`.

```
make WITH_XWAYLAND=YES
```

#### Building with screencopy support

Screencopy support allows tools like `grim` to work with `hikari`, it also
allows applications to copy the desktop content. This is disabled by default
and can be added by setting `WITH_SCREENCOPY`.

```
make WITH_SCREENCOPY=YES
```

#### Building with gammacontrol support

Gamma control is needed for tools like `redshift`. This is disabled by default
and can be enabled via setting `WITH_GAMMACONTROL`.

```
make WITH_GAMMACONTROL=YES
```

#### Building with layer-shell support

Some applications that are used to build desktop components require
`layer-shell`. Examples for this are `waybar`, `wofi` and `slurp`. To turn on
`layer-shell` support compile with the `WITH_LAYERSHELL` option.

```
make WITH_LAYERSHELL=YES
```

#### Building with virtual input support

Virtual input support is needed for applications like `wayvnc`.

```
make WITH_VIRTUAL_INPUT=YES
```

#### Building the manpage

Building the `hikari` manpage requires [`pandoc`](http://pandoc.org/). To build
the manpage just run `make VERSION=1.0.0 doc`, where `VERSION` is the version
number that will be spliced into the manpage. The distribution tarball of
`hikari` comes with a precompiled manpage removing the need for a `pandoc`
installation.

#### Installing without SUID

`hikari` requires root privileges during startup on BSD systems to initialize
the `wlroots` backend, those are dropped as soon as possible. If you don't
happen to need this you can prevent installation from setting this bit by
issuing `WITHOUT_SUID`. (SUID is still set for `hikari-unlocker` to allow
communication with PAM, which is required for password authentication)

```
make WITHOUT_SUID=YES install
```
